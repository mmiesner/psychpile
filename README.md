# psychpile
This is a very simple program I wrote to create evaluation templates for me in .docx format.
This is my first python program, and a learning experience for me as it draws very heavily on the python-docx library.
It is geared towards psychological evaluations, but of course can be tailored towards creating other templates.
I wrote it to work with my file system, so I have it set to my file locations. You will need to edit these locations.
You will also need to edit the locations of the template documents. 
Good luck.
